\section{Cromwell Server uptime}{

The Cromwell server started by this function will run for 7 days
and then shut down. However, your data persists across different
instances of Cromwell servers created by running this function.
You do however need to have a Cromwell server up and running to
retrieve data.
}

\section{Timeout}{

If the PROOF API is unavailable, this function will timeout after
5 seconds. Contact the package maintainer if you get a timeout error.
See \code{\link[=proof_timeout]{proof_timeout()}}.
